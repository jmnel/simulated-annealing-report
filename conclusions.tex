\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The work of Dekkers and Aarts have placed Simulated Annealing on a firm rigorous framework that enables further
work and understanding of stochastic global optimization methods. 

\subsection{A robust and efficient method}

Our emperical results, achieved with a non-optimized, and rather
crude implementation, show that Simlulated Annealing is both a robust and efficient method. Simulated Annealing has
outperformed the choosen global optimization methods provided by

\noindent\texttt{scipy.optimize}, in respect to our multiple
global minima test.

\subsection{Further work}

Simulated Annealing, Mutli-start, and the various other methods provided by \texttt{scipy.optimize} were used with
default parameters. Further exploration and analysis should be done to determine optimal parameters for all methods 
to get a fairer comparison between the different methods.

Regretably our small selection of test problems had a only a small number of global and local minima. It would be
insightful to explore test problems that have large numbers of minima. It is uncertain if our results would hold
in such a regime.

Lastly, another interesting avenue of exploration would be to develop different methods of point generation for the
Markov chains. Does there exist a way to sample points directly from a probability distribution using function information?
This would avoid the costly and wasteful discarding or a large number of points.
