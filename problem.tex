\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:prob}

Let $S\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded set on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f:S\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be an $n$-dimensional real-valued function. \\
The problem that simulated annealing wishes to solve is to find a point $x_{min} \in S$ such that $f(x_{min})$ is a global minimum on $S$. \\
\\
Specifically, 
\begin{equation}
    \forall x \in S : f(x_{\min}) \leq f(x)
    \label{eq:min-def}
\end{equation}

The problem deals with global minimization; however, simulated annealing can find global maximization in the same way by reversing the sign of $f$ without loss of generality [1].
